## K3s Installation

This repository contains a text file to install k3s master and worker node manually on aws console, and a directory named "Terraform" to provision one master and one worker k3s nodes using terraform.
Although, depending on our requirement we can change the amount of worker node to be provisioned under "count"(in locals of main.tf)
